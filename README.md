Weather Website Using OpenWeather API

This project is a weather website that uses the OpenWeather API to provide real-time weather information for various locations worldwide. Users can search for the weather in different cities or states, and the website dynamically displays weather data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions (e.g., clear skies, rain, etc.). The background of the website changes based on the current weather conditions, offering a visual representation that aligns with the climate (e.g., a sunny background for clear weather, a rainy one for stormy conditions).

Features:
Real-time weather data: Fetches current weather data from the OpenWeather API.
Location search: Users can enter any city or state worldwide to see the weather.
Dynamic background: Changes background images or colors depending on the weather conditions (sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.).
Weather details: Displays information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
Responsive design: Works seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
